#lcp is a quick shell script to locally copy last output 
#On a remote server via ssh and want to copy some file contents over without having to highlight and paste into a text file?
# just "cat <file>"   then   ./lcpy !!    and it's in your local root folder...no scping required!  (because who remembers that syntax, really?)

#USAGE  after viewing file in terminal through cat, more, less
# ./lcp !!

#check your ~/ folder.  Also if you download clipboard through APT you can uncomment the last line to put the file contents in your clipboard (X).
